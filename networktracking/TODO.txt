Go through documentation for LittleProxy to understand following classes :
    DefaultHttpProxyServer, HttpFilters, HttpFiltersAdapter, HttpProxyServerBootstrap, ChainedProxyManager

that will be used with these custom classes : 
    ProxyServerConfig, ProxyFilterFactory, ProxyRequestFilter, ProxyLogService, BlockedRequestEvaluator

7/4/25 - 7/7/25 
    not able to work on TODO items due to being busy

7/8/25
    Write some of the code for the proxy classes
    Fix code for whats needed with backend if issues occur

Get the BlockedRequestEvaluator class working fully with the 'hosts' file that is being requested
get the ProxyRequestFilter class working fully with the BlockedRequestEvaluator class

7/10/25
*Didnt work on missing methods due to adding and figuring out other code to handle HTTPS requests and certificate problems*
    Work on the missing methods in ProxyFilterFactory and ProxyServerConfig (if any are needed)
Work on fixing any bugs that might be present

    not able to work on TODO items due to being busy

ProxyFilterFactory isnt class that needed work it is ProxyRequestFilter which those methods have been planned out 
    and worked on some
Need to fix any bugs that are present or marked down
Fix issue that is occuring with running mvn clean install with the keystore file in ProxyServerRunner class
These methods are being used from the HttpFiltersAdapter interface
    clientToProxyRequest() - First request from client
    
    These two are optional and could be implemented in the future if needed
    proxyToServerRequest() - Request being sent to target server
    serverToProxyResponse() - Response from target server

7/15/24
Fix any bugs that are present in front end
Fix any bugs that appear in the backend portion with proxy
Implement whats needed to read the actual datagram and not just the HTTP request to be able to block HTTPS requests like on YouTube ads
    since those are DYNAMIC and not STATIC domain based 

7/16/24
Figure out issue with SSL handshake errors occuring with browser
    after this is figured out, work on other methods for blocking HTTPS and any other bugs

7/17/25
work on CustomCert classes so they correctly make the MITM logic work to be able to work with 
    HTTPS datagram
Work on any logic that is needed to block certain requests if MITM and HTTPS decryption stuff is finished

7/18/25
figure out high level layout of what needs to be done with custom cert classes so that it can work properly with HTTP
    and HTTPS to also be able to deal with the HTTPS datagrams

7/19/25 - 7/20/25
was busy so couldnt work on anything

7/21/25
implement what was figured out with the custom cert classes
work on any bugs or issues that are present or found

7/22/25
See what can be done about the RootCA problem failing

7/23/25
See which methods from LittleProxy mitm will correctly work with what is needed for the HTTPS certificate issue

7/24/25
Implement more of what is needed from the littleProxy-mitm methods to be able to do what is required

7/25/25
Wasnt able to work on errors or project due to being busy

7/26/25
Work on error BAD_CERTIFICATE error with proxy
Attempt to implement code for Browsermob-Proxy to see if that can help with the error as it creates a 
    dynamically created RootCA that can be saved and used

7/27/25
Wasnt able to work on project due to being busy

7/28/25
Work on logic to block unwanted HTTPS requests
    Work on anything else needed to go with the blocking logic

7/29/25
Test and see if theres are errors with the front end HTML and ThymeLeaf
Add more to the Https domains from youtube/google to block them

7/30/25
Get the Https domains to look for with youtube since most of the regular ads that 
    appear on webpages get blocked
Need to work on the checking logic for the ads that come through on youtube as some of them come through 
    even though in the console it logs that its showing intercepted but still comes through
