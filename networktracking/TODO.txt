    and worked on some
Need to fix any bugs that are present or marked down
Fix issue that is occuring with running mvn clean install with the keystore file in ProxyServerRunner class
These methods are being used from the HttpFiltersAdapter interface

    These two are optional and could be implemented in the future if needed
